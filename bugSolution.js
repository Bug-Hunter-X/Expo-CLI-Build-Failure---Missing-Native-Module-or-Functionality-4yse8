The specific solution depends on the missing native module.  However, here's a general approach:

1. **Identify the missing module:** Carefully examine the error messages. They might contain clues about the missing module or dependency.  Look for messages related to native libraries, linking errors, or missing dependencies.

2. **Install the module:** If it is a third-party library, use `expo install <module-name>`. If the module requires manual linking, the steps will depend on the specific module's documentation. 

3. **Check for compatibility:**  Ensure that the native module is compatible with your version of Expo and React Native.

4. **Verify installation and linking:** After installation, confirm that the module is properly linked and integrated into your project.  Look for any additional configuration steps in the module's documentation.

5. **Clean and rebuild:** After making changes, try `expo prebuild` or `expo start --clear` to completely clean and rebuild your application.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's assume the missing functionality was related to camera access:

// bug.js (Illustrative)
// ... code that attempts to use the camera ...

// bugSolution.js (Illustrative)
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

// ... code using the camera with proper permission handling ...

// Note: In reality you'd use expo-camera with the correct permission check and handling as demonstrated in the solution file.
