This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run an application that requires certain native modules or functionalities not properly configured or linked within the Expo project. The error message itself can be vague and difficult to track down, often not providing specific details about the missing native module or the underlying reason for the failure.  The error may manifest as a general build failure, a missing dependency error, or an unexpected runtime exception within the app.
