# Expo CLI Build Failure: Missing Native Module or Functionality

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error arises from the absence of a required native module or functionality during the build or runtime of an Expo application.

## Problem
The Expo CLI produces vague error messages when a native module or functionality is missing, making debugging challenging. The precise cause might not be immediately obvious.

## Solution
The solution depends on identifying the missing functionality. Thoroughly review the error logs, ensuring necessary native libraries are installed and correctly linked.  If using a third-party library, verify compatibility with Expo and proper installation.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run the application using `expo start`.  The app will likely fail to build due to a missing native module (demonstrated in `bug.js`).
3. Examine the solution in `bugSolution.js` to see how to address the issue.
